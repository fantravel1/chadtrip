  <!-- ========== A LAKE THAT DEFINES A REGION ========== -->
  <section class="section" id="overview">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <div class="content fade-in">
        <h2>A Lake That Defines a Region</h2>
        <p>
          Lake Chad is not simply a body of water. It is the geographic anchor of an entire basin, a freshwater system that once covered more than 25,000 square kilometers and supported some of the densest settlement patterns in the Sahel. For centuries, the lake has shaped trade, migration, agriculture, and identity across what is now Chad, Niger, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its peak in the early 1960s, Lake Chad was one of the largest lakes on the African continent. Its waters fed fisheries, irrigated farmland, and sustained pastoral communities across the basin. The Chari and Logone rivers, flowing north from the Central African highlands, provided the lake's primary inflow. Seasonal fluctuations were normal, but the overall system was stable enough to anchor millions of livelihoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this zone is to understand water as a force of geography. The lake does not simply sit in a landscape. It creates one. The vegetation patterns, settlement locations, and economic structures of the entire western border region follow the water.

  <!-- ========== ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE ========== -->

          <h2 class="section__title" style="text-align:left;">Environmental Change</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Since the 1960s, Lake Chad has lost approximately 90% of its surface area. What was once a massive freshwater body visible from space as a single continuous lake is now a fragmented system of open water, marshland, and islands. This is one of the most significant environmental transformations of the modern era.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The causes are compound. Reduced rainfall across the Sahel since the 1970s diminished inflow from the Chari-Logone river system. Simultaneously, irrigation projects upstream diverted water that once reached the lake. Population growth across the basin increased demand on a shrinking resource. No single cause explains the change. Climate, infrastructure, and demographics combined.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash);">
            The ecological consequences extend far beyond water levels. Fish populations have shifted. Bird migration patterns have changed. The lake's recession has exposed new land, creating both opportunity and conflict as communities adapt. The Lake Chad Basin Commission, an intergovernmental body, continues to coordinate responses, but the scale of change outpaces institutional capacity.

          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            More than 30 million people live in the Lake Chad Basin. Their livelihoods are directly tied to the water. Fishing communities have adapted to the lake's changes for decades, shifting their methods and locations as water recedes and returns with seasonal patterns. Farmers cultivate the exposed lakebed, growing crops on newly available land. Pastoralists graze herds along the margins.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The cross-border dynamics of the lake zone create a distinct cultural geography. Kanuri, Buduma, Hausa, and Arab communities interact across national boundaries that the lake predates. Trade networks span all four countries. Languages and customs flow across borders as readily as the water once did.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash);">
            Community resilience here is not a narrative device. It is a material fact. People have reorganized their economies, settlement patterns, and resource-sharing arrangements in response to environmental change. Understanding this adaptability is essential context for any travel in the zone.

        <h2 class="section__title">What Travel Here Means</h2>
        <p class="section__desc">
          Lake Chad is not a leisure destination. Travel to this zone is research travel, documentary travel, or geography travel. It demands preparation, context, and purpose.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content fade-in" style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.7);">
        <p>
          If you travel to Lake Chad, you are traveling to understand something. The environmental changes here are among the most documented and least visited on the continent. Satellite imagery tells one story. Being present in the landscape tells another. The scale of change is difficult to comprehend from data alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research travelers, documentary teams, and environmental journalists have reasons to be here. Photographers documenting climate change, geographers studying basin hydrology, and NGO workers engaged in development programs form the primary visitor base. Casual tourism infrastructure does not exist in any meaningful sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not a place to arrive without arrangements. Access requires coordination with local guides, sometimes with military or administrative clearance, and always with sensitivity to communities that have been the subject of outside observation for decades. Travel here must be purposeful, respectful, and well-planned.

        <h2 class="section__title">Seasonal Notes</h2>
        <p class="section__desc">
          Water levels, access, and conditions at Lake Chad vary significantly throughout the year. Planning around the seasonal cycle is not optional.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content fade-in">
        <h3>Dry Season (November &ndash; April)</h3>
        <p>
          The dry season is the most practical window for travel to the Lake Chad zone. Water levels are lower, exposing more of the lakebed and making overland access more reliable. Roads and tracks that become impassable during rains are generally navigable. Temperatures are high but manageable in the early months, rising sharply from March onward.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is when the lake's transformation is most visually apparent. The contrast between the current waterline and historical extent is stark. Fishing activity concentrates around remaining open water channels, and farming on exposed lakebed is in full production.
        </p>

        <h3>Rainy Season (June &ndash; September)</h3>
        <p>
          The rainy season brings renewed water flow from the Chari and Logone rivers. The lake expands, marshes fill, and access becomes significantly more difficult. Roads in the region are unpaved and prone to flooding. Vehicle movement may be restricted or impossible for days at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those with research mandates that require wet-season observation, travel is possible but requires experienced local operators, appropriate vehicles, and contingency planning for delays. This is not a season for improvisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Transition Periods (May, October)</h3>
        <p>
          May marks the onset of rains; October marks their retreat. Both months are unpredictable. Access conditions can change rapidly. These shoulder periods are generally best avoided unless you have specific reasons and reliable local intelligence about current conditions.
