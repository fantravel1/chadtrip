  <!-- ========== WHAT THE SAHEL FEELS LIKE ========== -->

    <div class="container">
      <div class="two-col fade-in">
        <div>
          <span class="section__label">The Landscape</span>
          <h2 class="section__title" style="text-align:left;">What the Sahel Feels Like</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The Sahel is not desert and it is not savannah. It is the zone between. A belt of semi-arid land running roughly east-west across Central Chad, where annual rainfall sits between 200 and 600 millimeters &mdash; enough to sustain scattered trees, seasonal grasses, and a way of life built around the rhythm of wet and dry.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The light here is particular. Golden, low-angled, filtered through dust and dry air. Acacia trees stand widely spaced across flat terrain, casting sharp shadows in the morning and dissolving into silhouettes at dusk. The land is open and the horizon is long. You can see weather approaching from an hour away.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash);">
            This is not empty land. The Sahel is populated, worked, and traveled. It is one of the world's great ecological transition zones &mdash; a place where geography directly shapes how people live, move, and trade. What looks sparse to the unfamiliar eye is in fact a landscape of careful adaptation.
          </p>

          The Sahel does not announce itself. There is no border between desert and green. The transition is gradual &mdash; an acacia here, a patch of grass there &mdash; until you realize the landscape has changed beneath you.

        <p class="section__desc">
          The Sahel supports both pastoral and agricultural livelihoods. Communities here have shaped their lives around seasonal water, grazing routes, and the market towns that serve as nodes of trade and culture.

            Pastoral communities &mdash; herders of cattle, goats, and camels &mdash; move through the Sahel seasonally, following water and grazing. Their routes are ancient, mapped not on paper but in knowledge passed between generations. Agricultural communities concentrate near seasonal watercourses and in areas where rainfall supports millet, sorghum, and groundnuts.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Market towns like Ab&eacute;ch&eacute;, Ati, and Mongo serve as meeting points where pastoral and settled communities converge. These towns are not tourist destinations in any conventional sense, but they are the living infrastructure of Sahelian life &mdash; places where goods, languages, and traditions cross paths.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash);">
            The Sahel is a cultural corridor. It connects the Arabic-influenced north with the more linguistically diverse south. Multiple ethnic groups &mdash; including the Ouaddai, Zaghawa, Hadjerai, and Arab pastoralists &mdash; share this belt of land, each adapted to its specific conditions in distinct ways.

          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-xl);">
            The Sahel's character changes fundamentally between the dry season and the rainy season. Travel planning in this zone is inseparable from seasonal awareness.
          </p>

          <h3 style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Dry Season (October &ndash; May)</h3>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The primary travel window. Roads are at their most passable. Dust is constant. Temperatures climb sharply from February onward, with March through May reaching extreme heat. The landscape is brown and gold, trees are bare or sparse, and water sources contract. This is when overland routes are most reliable, but the heat demands serious physical preparation.
          </p>

          <h3 style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Rainy Season (June &ndash; September)</h3>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash);">
            The rains transform the Sahel. Dry riverbeds fill. Grasslands green. The landscape softens. But unpaved roads can become impassable. Wadis flood without warning. Vehicle travel becomes unreliable in many areas. The rainy season is ecologically significant &mdash; it is when the Sahel looks most alive &mdash; but it is not the practical season for most overland travel. Travelers in this period must accept delays, diversions, and uncertainty.
