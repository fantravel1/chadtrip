  <!-- ========== WHAT THE SAVANNAH FEELS LIKE ========== -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <div class="content fade-in">
        <span class="section__label">Zone Overview</span>
        <h2>What the Savannah Feels Like</h2>
        <p>
          After the mineral silence of the Sahara and the dry expanses of the Sahel, the south is a different country. The Sudanian savannah zone occupies the lower third of Chad, stretching from roughly the 10th parallel southward to the borders with Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Here, the land turns green. Trees hold their leaves. Rivers carry water for much of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not jungle. The savannah is open grassland punctuated by woodland, gallery forests along river corridors, and broad floodplains that fill and recede with the seasons. The Chari and Logone rivers define the western edge of this zone, flowing northwest toward Lake Chad and forming the hydrological spine of southern Chad. Smaller tributaries fan out across the region, creating agricultural corridors that have sustained communities for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The landscape is greener, but it is not gentle. The rainy season transforms roads into impassable clay. The dry season bakes the same ground hard. The vegetation is adapted to extremes &mdash; thorned acacia, shea trees, neem, and balanites that store water and shed leaves strategically. This is land shaped by seasonal rhythm, not constant abundance.
        </p>
        <p>
          What distinguishes the savannah from the zones to the north is density. More people, more villages, more markets, more movement. This is where the majority of Chad's population lives, and it is where the country's agricultural economy is concentrated. Cotton, sorghum, millet, peanuts, and rice are staple crops. Cattle herding overlaps with settled farming, creating both cooperation and tension at seasonal boundaries.

          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The southern savannah is home to the Sara people, the largest ethnic group in Chad. Sara communities are predominantly agricultural, organized around extended family compounds in villages that cluster along rivers and roads. Their culture is rooted in farming cycles, community labor, and oral traditions that connect land use to identity.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Markets are the social infrastructure of the south. Weekly markets in towns like Moundou, Sarh, and Bongor draw traders, farmers, and herders from surrounding areas. These are not tourist markets. They are functional economic hubs where grain, livestock, textiles, and tools change hands. Arriving at a southern Chadian market is the fastest way to understand how the region actually works.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            N'Djamena, the capital, sits at the confluence of the Chari and Logone rivers at the northern edge of the savannah. It is the country's only city with international air connections, banking infrastructure, and a significant expatriate presence. Most overland travel in Chad begins and ends in N'Djamena, making it both a logistical hub and a cultural introduction to the contrasts that define the country.

          <h2 class="section__title" style="text-align:left;">Wildlife Corridors</h2>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The southern savannah contains Chad's most significant remaining wildlife populations. The anchor is Zakouma National Park, located in the southeastern savannah near the town of Am Timan. Zakouma is one of the most important protected areas in Central Africa and has become a reference point for conservation efforts across the Sahel-Savannah transition.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Elephant herds in Zakouma have recovered from catastrophic poaching in the 2000s through sustained anti-poaching operations and community engagement. The park also supports populations of giraffe, buffalo, lion, and large concentrations of waterbirds along its seasonal floodplains. This is not a game-drive destination in the East African sense. There are no lodges on every ridge. The infrastructure is minimal, the access is seasonal, and the experience is shaped by the land rather than by tourist convenience.
          </p>
          <p style="color: var(--color-ash); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Beyond Zakouma, wildlife corridors extend through unfenced savannah between Chad, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. These transboundary movements are part of a larger ecological system that predates national borders. Encountering wildlife here means understanding that animals move through a landscape shared with farmers, herders, and communities whose relationship with wildlife is complex, practical, and not defined by foreign conservation narratives.

  <!-- ========== SEASONAL NOTES ========== -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <div class="content fade-in">
        <span class="section__label">Timing</span>
        <h2>Seasonal Notes</h2>
        <p>
          The savannah's character changes dramatically between seasons. Understanding this cycle is not optional &mdash; it determines whether roads are passable, whether parks are open, and whether your trip is viable at all.
        </p>

        <h3>Rainy Season: June to September</h3>
        <p>
          The rains transform the south. Rivers swell, floodplains fill, and laterite roads dissolve into red clay that can trap even well-equipped vehicles. Many secondary routes become completely impassable from July through September. Zakouma National Park closes during the rains. N'Djamena itself can experience significant flooding in heavy rain years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upside of the rains is the landscape. The savannah turns a deep green, birdlife peaks, and the rivers are at their most dramatic. If you are based in N'Djamena and not planning overland travel, the rainy season offers a different visual experience of the south. But for expedition travel, it is a season to avoid.
        </p>

        <h3>Dry Season: October to May</h3>
        <p>
          The dry season is the travel window. Roads firm up by November. Zakouma typically opens in late October or early November. The cool dry months of December through February offer the most comfortable travel conditions, with lower humidity and temperatures that are demanding but manageable.
        </p>
        <p>
          From March onward, heat intensifies significantly. April and May can see temperatures exceeding 45&deg;C in the south. Travel is still possible, but the physical toll increases and water management becomes more critical. The sweet spot for southern savannah travel is November through February.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The savannah runs on a seasonal clock. Plan around it or the land will plan for you.
